> üôèüôèüôè Scream for help to Ukraine üá∫üá¶
> 
> 24 February 2022, Russia started bombing cities with peacefully civilized population in whole Ukraine. And has been doing it up to this day. Breaking all laws of war. Their bombs has been killing children and adults. This deserves Hague court.
> - üè† If you are from Russia, please stop your government by any means including protests, don't trust local media, they are bribed by the government. They always was. I am sure you already feel lie by unexplainable crazy things in your country caused by world sanctions.
> - üí£ Please spread the information about bombing of Ukraine in all social way you could. Russia treacherously broke into the territory of a sovereign state. Do not trust to anything from Russian media, most likely it will be bullshit
> - üíº If you have any kind of business cooperation with Russia, please block it now and keep most of money on your side, this is the only possible ethical decision
> - ‚ò¢Ô∏è Ask your government to stop Russia from spreading invasion in any way. Russia is nuclear threat to the whole world. You think it is not possible? We thought that bombing of independent country with population of 44.13 million is also not possible.

Advantages üí™
=============

- It is lightweight and minimalistic - written with vanilla JS, you don't need dependencies to use it
- Designed to process images with minimal clicks, most actions support hot-keys
- Could be easily integrated into SPA application (React, Vue, Angular)
- Could be used in Electron and Cordova apps
- Flexibale image saving - you provide your save handler, and get base64 data with any jpeg/png compression
- Could be translated to any language 

Originally Painterro was designed for quick screenshots processing: You make screenshot by pressing `PrtSc` button,
then open Painterro on your website, paste an image with `Ctrl+V`,
crop it to interested area, highlight something with line/rectangle tool and/or add some text 
to the image and save on server with custom save handler (e.g. simple `XHR` request to your backend).
In addition, you can use Painterro as image editor for any kind of raster images. Please try a [demo](https://tracklify.com/painterro_demo/).
Also painterro has [Wordpress Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/painterro/).

If you want to see some feature in Painterro, please leave (or vote for) an issue [here](https://github.com/devforth/painterro/issues).
There is no promise that it will be implemented soon or ever, but it is interesting to know what features users want to have.

```
{ 
  image: {
   asBlob: ∆í asBlob(type, quality) // returns blob
   asDataURL: ∆í asDataURL(type, quality) // returns e.g. "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQS...."

}
```




UI color scheme
---------------

Next group of params used to configure painterro user interface in simple "JS way". 
They should be placed under `colorScheme` group, for example:
```js
Painterro({
  colorScheme: {
    main: '#fdf6b8', // make panels light-yellow
    control: '#FECF67' // change controls color
  }
}).show()
```

| Param | Description | Default |
|-|-|-|
|`main` | Color of panels, take most of UI space | `'#fff'` |
|`control` | Color of controls background (e.g. button background) | `'#fff'` |
|`controlShadow` | Color controls box shadow | `'0px 0px 3px 1px #bbb'` |
|`controlContent` | Content of controls (e.g. button text) | `'#000000'` |
|`activeControl` | Color for control when it active (e.g. button pressed) | `'#7485B1'` |
|`activeControlContent` | Color for activated control content | `main` |
|`inputBorderColor` | You can add border to inputs, by default color is same as `main` so borders will not be seen | `main` |
|`inputBackground` | Background of inputs | `'#ffffff'` |
|`inputShadow` | shadow of input | `'inset 0 0 4px 1px #ccc'` |

|`hoverControlContent`| Controls background color when mouse hovered | `'#1a3d67'` |
|`toolControlNameColor`| Color of toolbar labels that prepend controls | `rgba(255,255,255,0.7)` |

> NOTE: all these params are defined only for simplicity, you are free to redefine them in your cascade style files (we don't use importants and so on, so all props should be easily editable). This mettod is recommended for experts - because you can use your CSS preprocessor variables and adopt Painterro for your design. Example usecase is different color of shadows for a buttons with `::after`/`::before`

API
-------

**.show([optional]openImage, [optional]initialMimeType)** - Shows painterro instance. `openImage` can have next values:

* `false` - will open image that already was drawn before last close
* `some string value`, e.g. `'http://placehold.it/120x120&text=image1'` - will try to load image from url
* all another values - will clear content before open

`initialMimeType` could be used to help painterro understand which file do you try to load there. Could be useful if you want to save the original mime and file opened explicitly (painterro open tool or dnd/ctrl+v handlers get it automatically)

**.hide()** - hide instance


**.save()** - call save (same save as on buttons bar). Can be used if save button is hidden (`hiddenTools: ['save']`)

**.doScale({ width, height, scale })** - scale the image and resize area.

Scale to match the width and scale height proportinally (e.g. 50x32 will become 100->64):

```
.doScale({width: 100})
```

Scale to fill width and height (e.g. 50x32 will become 11->15):

```
.doScale({width: 11, height: 15})
```

Scale x2  (e.g. 11x12 will become 22->24):

```
.doScale({ scale: 2 })
```

**setZoom(zoomPercentage)** - sets the current zoom percentage


Example:

```js
var p = Painterro()
p.show()
```

Translation üìô
--------------

Want to translate Painterro into your language?

If you need one of languages in table below, just pass pass `language` parameter, for example:
 
```js
Painterro({
  language: 'es'  // Spanish
}).show()
```
Translated languages:

| `language` param | Name |
|-|-|
| `ca` | Catalan |
| `de` | German |
| `en` | English |
| `es` | Spanish |
| `fa` | Iran-Farsi (Persian (Ir-Fa) |
| `fr` | French |
| `ja` | Japanese |
| `pl` | Polish |
| `pt-PT` | European Portuguese |
| `pt-BR` | Brazilian  Portuguese |
| `ru` | Russian |
| `nl` | Dutch |



If you want to add another language, then:

1. fork to your GitHub with button on top.
2. Create empty file in folder langs [<LANG_ISO_CODE>.lang.js] for your translation. `LANG_ISO_CODE` should follow [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
3. Copy content from [langs/en.lang.js] to a new file
4. Then translate all `'Strings'`
5. Add reference in [js/translation.js] inside of your repo. 
5. After that create pull-request, or just open [issue](https://github.com/devforth/painterro/issues) if you don't know how to create a PR.

ü§î Found a bug in some word for your language? Feel free to edit on GitHub directly and suggest a fix.
 
If you want to translate or change strings without contributing you can do this by passing 
`translation` parameter, for example:

```js
Painterro({
  translation: {
    name: 'ua',
    strings: {
      apply: '–ó–∞—Å—Ç–æ—Å—É–≤–∞—Ç–∏'    
      // other strings
    }
  }
}).show()
```
For all strings that should be translated, see [langs/en.lang.js] 
    

Saving image üíæ
===============

You should provide your own save handler, that will post/update image on server or will pass image to other
frontend components. In this section we will provide several backend examples on python Flask (easiest web server for python). Anyway if you will face any python exception you can use super-helpfull [fixexception.com](https://fixexception.com/) service to fix any issue you will face üí™.

Binary saving
-------------

You can post data with binary `multipart/form-data` request which is the most efficient way to pass data to backend. Example uses raw `XMLHttpRequest`. Of course,
 you can use `fetch`, `jQuery`, etc insead.

```js
var ptro = Painterro({
  saveHandler: function (image, done) {
    var formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('image', image.asBlob());
    // you can also pass suggested filename 
    // formData.append('image', image.asBlob(), image.suggestedFileName());
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open('POST', 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/save-as-binary/', true);
    xhr.onload = xhr.onerror = function () {
      // after saving is done, call done callback
      done(true); //done(true) will hide painterro, done(false) will leave opened
    };
    xhr.send(formData);
  }
})
ptro.show();
```
Here is python flask backend example (of course same can be implemented using any technology):
```python
@app.route("/save-as-binary/", methods=['POST'])
def binary_saver():
    filename = '{:10d}.png'.format(int(time()))  # generate some filename
    filepath = os.path.join(get_tmp_dir(), filename)
    request.files['image'].save(filepath)
    return jsonify({})
```

See full example in `example` directory. You can run it used python3 with installed `Flask` (`pip install flask`).

Base64 saving
-------------


You can also same image by posting `base64` string via plain POST json call.
Please note that base64 encoding is less efficient then binary data, for example some `1920 x 1080` image took `402398` bytes for `base64` upload.
The same image took `301949` bytes with `multipart/form-data`.


```js
var ptro = Painterro({
    saveHandler: function (image, done) {
      // of course, instead of raw XHR you can use fetch, jQuery, etc
      var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
      xhr.open("POST", "http://127.0.0.1:5000/save-as-base64/");
      xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
      xhr.send(JSON.stringify({
        image: image.asDataURL()
      }));
      xhr.onload = function (e) {
        // after saving is done, call done callback
        done(true); //done(true) will hide painterro, done(false) will leave opened
      }
    },
    activeColor: '#00b400'  // change active color to green
});
ptro.show();
```
Backend should convert `base64` to binary and save file:
```python
@app.route("/save-as-base64/", methods=['POST'])
def base64_saver():
    filename = '{:10d}.png'.format(int(time()))  # generate some filename
    filepath = os.path.join(get_tmp_dir(), filename)
    with open(filepath, "wb") as fh:
        base64_data = request.json['image'].replace('data:image/png;base64,', '')
        fh.write(base64.b64decode(base64_data))
    return jsonify({})
```


Saving to WYSIWYG
-----------------

You can just insert image as data url to any WYSIWYG editor, e.g. TinyMCE:
```js
    tinymce.init({ selector:'textarea', });
    var ptro = Painterro({
      saveHandler: function (image, done) {
        tinymce.activeEditor.execCommand('mceInsertContent', false, '<img src="' + image.asDataURL() + '" />');
        // after saving is done, call done callback
        done(true); //done(true) will hide painterro, done(false) will leave opened
      }
    })
```

Format and quality
------------------

When you call `image.asDataURL()` or `image.asBlob()`, you can also specify image mime type (format), e.g.
`image.asDataURL('image/jpeg')`. 

Default type is mimetype used by image which was loaded into Painterro, or "image/png" if image was created from scratch.

If type is `image/jpeg` or `image/webp`, you can also define image quality from `0.0` to `1.0`, default is `0.92`,
example: `image.asDataURL('image/jpeg', 0.5)`


Save to jpeg or png depending on whether there is an alpha channel
------------------

An efficient way to save an image might be implmented by checking whether image has some alpha pixels:
* If yes - we need to serve image in less efficient png format
* Otherwise lets just use JPEG
This is very simple with next:

```
var ptro = Painterro({
  saveHandler: function (image, done) {

    image.asBlob(image.hasAlphaChannel() ? 'image/png' : 'image/jpeg');
    // upload blob
  }
})
```

Example: Open Painterro by Ctrl+V
-----------------

```js
document.onpaste = (event) => {
  const { items } = event.clipboardData || event.originalEvent.clipboardData;
  Array.from(items).forEach((item) => {
    if (item.kind === 'file') {
      if (!window.painterroOpenedInstance) {
        // if painterro already opened - it will handle onpaste
        const blob = item.getAsFile();
        const reader = new FileReader();
        reader.onload = (readerEvent) => {
            window.painterroOpenedInstance = Painterro({
              onHide: () => {
                window.painterroOpenedInstance = undefined;
              },
              saveHandler: (image, done) => {
                console.log('Save it here', image.asDataURL());  // you could provide your save handler
                done(true);
              },
            }).show(readerEvent.target.result, item.type);
        };
        reader.readAsDataURL(blob);
      }
    }
  });
};
```

Development üî®
==============

Code written on ES6 which transplited by Babel and packed (minified) to a single file using webpack. All configs are inside so all you have to do after pulling repo is installing node modules:

```bash
cd painterro
npm ci
```

Building painterro
------------------

```bash
npm run build
```

Result file for `<script>` import is `build/painterro.min.js`.

Actually, above command produces 4 versions of library:

- `build/painterro-x.y.z.min.js`, `build/painterro.min.js` the same files but with different filenames (with and without versiontag) - this is `var` version which will be loaded as global variable (`var painterro = <Library class>`) when you will import it as `<script src='painterro.min.js' />` tag. So this is for `script` tag only.   
- `build/painterro.commonjs2.js` - this version sutable for js `require/import`. That's why it is used as entry point in `package.json` file - if you are using webpack or other tool that can handle `require/import` of `commonjs2` libraries then you can do `npm install painterro`, and do `import painterro` and it will use `commonjs2` version.
- `build/painterro.amd.js` and `build/painterro.umd.js` - these both are same as above but for `AMD` and `UMD` importers respectivly.


Dev-server
----------

To start hot-reload dev server (for reloading code "on the fly"):
```bash
npm run dev
```
Then open http://localhost:8080 with demo page


Editing source on the fly for painterro imported from side webpack app (e.g. your project SPA)
------------------------------------------

1. If your side app uses 'eslint' it, most likely side app will need eslint-plugin-import:

```
npm i eslint-plugin-import
```

2. Since compiled painterro commonjs2 file already linted and minimized you need to exclude it from linting:

Add to package.json of your side app:
```
  "eslintIgnore": [
    "/home/ivan/devforth/painterro/build/painterro2.commonjs.js"
  ],
```
where `/home/ivan/devforth/painterro` is a folder with Painterro sources

3. Replace

```
import Painterro from 'painterro';
```
with
 
```
import Painterro from '/home/ivan/devforth/painterro/build/painterro.commonjs2.js';
```

4. Go to painterro source folder and run:

```
watch npm run build
```

Regenerating icons font
-----------------------

If you need add/edit icons in `res` folder, please after editing run:

```bash
npm run buildfont
```

For font generation we use method described here: [How to generate a webfont (automated setup)](https://hinty.io/brucehardywald/how-to-generate-a-webfont-automated-setup/)
